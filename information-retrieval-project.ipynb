Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?

Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)Can you reconcile this?I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.

The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.</td>\n",

It is possible to objectivelydetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state thateverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean thatit cannot be objective in theory.Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likelythe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since theclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective systembecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which wouldnecessitate some sort of grand design?I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesiredbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,immoral to what end?).</td>\n",

Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still.  Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --</td>\n",

I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.</td>\n",

I have writtenthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boilingto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of noone, except myself ;-)][...]\\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\\tcontent in their ignorance.\\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\ta more expansive view.\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\tBlatant assertion.

However, they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, andnot an entirely different source.   We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors.

It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.   When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three?   Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?   That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.

He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to \"tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead\" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of \"paradise\" when he \"heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by \"babes\" were \"forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptismsand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.We can discuss certain concepts regarding theendowment (\"the ritual\").However, there are certain elements I can notdiscuss with anyone (including other saints)outside of the temple.As a portion of the endowment, we receive thetokens and signs that will permit us accessto Heaven.

I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,</td>\n",

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

this?And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.You are attaching too many things to the term \"moral,\" I think.Let's try this:  is it \"good\" that animals of the same speciesdon't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Doesthe being need to be self aware?What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals ofthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don'tyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?   \n",

McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd senseof history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who weremostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most peopletoday? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only thecream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone inthe medieval period \"knew the rules\" it was a matter of uncriticallyaccepting what they were told.Bill Mayne   \n",

To me,an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)Can you reconcile this?I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your ownbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that you in fact interpret?   \n",

The origonaldraft didn't make it through the moderators quote-screens. So I didviolence to it, but if you remember the article I am respondingto it should still make sence.What, no hello for heathan netters?I feel all left out now. :([deletia- table of content, intro, homosexuality][deletia- incorrect attributions]Uh, you have your attributions wrong, you were respondingto my article, so Dan Johnson should be the 1st one.[deletia- no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat.]Ah, in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence?Not me! Cosmicly, we don't even exist for all practical purposes.I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.It would just say: \"don't bother.\"Luckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talkabout. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar andcountless others is still with us, although their works have perished.But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if theyare utterly forgotten.One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, whichI do not)But in that time we can make a difference.In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all thepoint you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobodyto ask, \"Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna makemuch of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?\".But they will have already have made a difference, great or small,before the end.Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?Little is in the eye of the beholder, of course.I don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. Andit does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely mydefinitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:\"Reality\"\\tThat which is real.\"Illusion\"\\tThat which is not real, but seems to be.\"Real\"\\t\\tObjectively ExistingFor \"reality\" to be an \"illusion\" would mean, then:That which is real is not real, but seems to be.Or:That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, butdoes seem to objectively exist.From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get acontradiction, that no things objectively exist.But I have a problem with this because I would like to saythat *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sumand all that.Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:\"Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.\"Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.Have on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusiontoo? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusionas well?If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,please show that this is true. If not, please explain how thiscan give a purpose to anything.How does it do that?Wouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation forsome *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.What pressure?It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless yourgoals either include doing so or require doing so before theythemselves can be achived.Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves thatdo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Checkout yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is notat all the same thing.Why is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in thisgoal? To you? To God? To the mysterious Purpose?[deletia- question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote.]I'll have a crack at that.(1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It isthe concept of life without death, life without end.(2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.(2a) No metaphor is adequate next to eternity; if it were we could notunderstand it either.

It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, asfar as I can tell.  It doesn't belittle anyone.  It does not substituteoffensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).We shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are \"dirty\"merely because so many are.And we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.

I believe that just as those who were saved in the OT, could only be saved because Jesus would one dayreconcile God to man, He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by God.\\tFor all of us have become like one who is unclean,\\tAnd all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;\\tAnd all of us wither like a leaf,\\tand our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\\t\\t\\t\\t-Isaiah 64:6, NASOur prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to theFather because they are tainted by our sin.

      No, IMO, Mr. Stowell missed the point.Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.I don't see how that necessarily follows.  Are all truths also absolutes?Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, andwhich truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding Biblical interpretation.I find Mr. Stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.   \n",

 My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.  (Ps. 32:1).and quoted by the apostle Paul:  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God  imputeth righteousness without works,  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins  are covered.  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering areparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensationaldistinction is unwarranted.I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus isgoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- formillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiverwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interestingspeculation, though.I'll leave comments on the so-called \"bema seat\" vs. \"throne\" judgments tosomeone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions aladispensationalism.   \n",

don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.   \n",

You don't need any excess informationother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectivelydetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state thateverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean thatit cannot be objective in theory.Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likelythe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since theclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective systembecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which wouldnecessitate some sort of grand design?I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesiredbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,immoral to what end?).   \n",

get involved, but...   :-)[bit deleted]Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was.Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still.  Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --   \n",

I don't know if this isbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.   \n",

I have writtenthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boilingto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of noone, except myself ;-)][...]\\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\\tcontent in their ignorance.\\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\ta more expansive view.\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\\tknit relationship with this appelation.\\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\\tthings flow.\\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\\tgone by this time.

However, they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, andnot an entirely different source.   We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usualexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not considertheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.   When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three?   Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?   That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.  In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look likeand arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.   \n",

He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to \"tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead\" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of \"paradise\" when he \"heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by \"babes\" were \"forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptismsand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.We can discuss certain concepts regarding theendowment (\"the ritual\").However, there are certain elements I can notdiscuss with anyone (including other saints)outside of the temple.As a portion of the endowment, we receive thetokens and signs that will permit us accessto Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred and respect the conditions under which it isrevealed to me.   \n",

I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,   \n",

                                             The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance. A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.   \n",

There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?</td>\n",

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?

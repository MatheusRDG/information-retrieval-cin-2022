As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.

There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?</td>\n",

Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.

I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.

The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.

Therefore, some revisions are in order, since theclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective systembecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which wouldnecessitate some sort of grand design?I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesiredbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,immoral to what end?).</td>\n",

Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still.  Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --</td>\n",

I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.</td>\n",

There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.

They are: 1) humans are animal\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\ta more expansive view.\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\tarts that humans do?

It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text.

Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?   That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself.

After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to \"tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead\" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2.

I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,</td>\n",

Mybrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due toother problems with the relationship).

Youwould like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hashthings out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, andpossibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope totie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmerwould include:   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that thisrelationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don'tunderstand where you're coming from.)   reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that wedid this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for thiswas ....)   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really aredecorational and functional at the same time.)   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be somegunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but weretruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, thisshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologizeabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping thingssmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty betweenwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be acompromise.

I think basically the reasoning was that thetradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin wasmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virginfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born witha predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predispositionbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When sciencediscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume thatMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemedto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, thatbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Vera Shanti Noyes writes;Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine asRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Churchhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to saythat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in freewill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is alsoaffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists andJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up withthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of finalperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that thosewithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew theirobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not needit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their owneffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestinedthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perishbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they weredeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, andsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody someblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  Andthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this oneor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporalpunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder wereforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And Ineed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement isquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred fromthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.not a &gt;good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should wenot &gt;stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be moreWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), butdoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with theU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am anisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But inthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarilyinvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are thepeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Ouractions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which isunrelated to anything to justify it for us.</td>\n",

I find it hard to seehow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boastin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,Jesus, for instance.I speak against strong atheism.

       "      <td>There are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard.\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesiesanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let anothertake\" concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able tolabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.</td>\n",

IsGod trying to confuse us?But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portrudingfrom varying translations of biblical texts by \"serious students\" thatare much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible,then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would beno need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybethe Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough toread it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving ussomething we cannot use correctly.IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,you are on weak ground.

This Word that John istrying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplationof the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

this?And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.You are attaching too many things to the term \"moral,\" I think.Let's try this:  is it \"good\" that animals of the same speciesdon't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Doesthe being need to be self aware?What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals ofthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don'tyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?   \n",

McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd senseof history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who weremostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most peopletoday? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only thecream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone inthe medieval period \"knew the rules\" it was a matter of uncriticallyaccepting what they were told.Bill Mayne   \n",

To me,an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)Can you reconcile this?I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your ownbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that you in fact interpret?   \n",

The origonaldraft didn't make it through the moderators quote-screens. So I didviolence to it, but if you remember the article I am respondingto it should still make sence.What, no hello for heathan netters?I feel all left out now. :([deletia- table of content, intro, homosexuality][deletia- incorrect attributions]Uh, you have your attributions wrong, you were respondingto my article, so Dan Johnson should be the 1st one.[deletia- no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat.]Ah, in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence?Not me! Cosmicly, we don't even exist for all practical purposes.I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.It would just say: \"don't bother.\"Luckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talkabout. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar andcountless others is still with us, although their works have perished.But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if theyare utterly forgotten.One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, whichI do not)But in that time we can make a difference.In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all thepoint you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobodyto ask, \"Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna makemuch of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?\".But they will have already have made a difference, great or small,before the end.Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?Little is in the eye of the beholder, of course.I don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. Andit does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely mydefinitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:\"Reality\"\\tThat which is real.\"Illusion\"\\tThat which is not real, but seems to be.\"Real\"\\t\\tObjectively ExistingFor \"reality\" to be an \"illusion\" would mean, then:That which is real is not real, but seems to be.Or:That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, butdoes seem to objectively exist.From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get acontradiction, that no things objectively exist.But I have a problem with this because I would like to saythat *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sumand all that.Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:\"Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.\"Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.Have on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusiontoo? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusionas well?If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,please show that this is true. If not, please explain how thiscan give a purpose to anything.How does it do that?Wouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation forsome *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.What pressure?It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless yourgoals either include doing so or require doing so before theythemselves can be achived.Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves thatdo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Checkout yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is notat all the same thing.Why is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in thisgoal? To you? To God? To the mysterious Purpose?[deletia- question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote.]I'll have a crack at that.(1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It isthe concept of life without death, life without end.(2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.(2a) No metaphor is adequate next to eternity; if it were we could notunderstand it either.

             ...But what was wrong with it?  It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, asfar as I can tell.  It doesn't belittle anyone.  It does not substituteoffensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).We shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are \"dirty\"merely because so many are.And we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.  It can be the directopposite -- a symptom of the _lack_ of a healthy perspective on God'screation.   \n",

I believe that just as those who were saved in the OT, could only be saved because Jesus would one dayreconcile God to man, He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by God.\\tFor all of us have become like one who is unclean,\\tAnd all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;\\tAnd all of us wither like a leaf,\\tand our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\\t\\t\\t\\t-Isaiah 64:6, NASOur prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to theFather because they are tainted by our sin.

      No, IMO, Mr. Stowell missed the point.Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.I don't see how that necessarily follows.  Are all truths also absolutes?Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, andwhich truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding Biblical interpretation.I find Mr. Stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.   \n",

 My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.  (Ps. 32:1).and quoted by the apostle Paul:  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God  imputeth righteousness without works,  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins  are covered.  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering areparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensationaldistinction is unwarranted.I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus isgoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- formillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiverwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interestingspeculation, though.I'll leave comments on the so-called \"bema seat\" vs. \"throne\" judgments tosomeone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions aladispensationalism.   \n",

don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.   \n",

You don't need any excess informationother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectivelydetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state thateverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean thatit cannot be objective in theory.Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likelythe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since theclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective systembecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which wouldnecessitate some sort of grand design?I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesiredbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,immoral to what end?).   \n",

get involved, but...   :-)[bit deleted]Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was.Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still.  Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --   \n",

I don't know if this isbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.   \n",

I have writtenthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boilingto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of noone, except myself ;-)][...]\\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\\tcontent in their ignorance.\\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\ta more expansive view.\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\\tknit relationship with this appelation.\\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\\tthings flow.\\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\\tgone by this time.

However, they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, andnot an entirely different source.   We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usualexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not considertheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.   When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three?   Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?   That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.  In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look likeand arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.   \n",

He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to \"tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead\" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of \"paradise\" when he \"heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by \"babes\" were \"forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptismsand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.We can discuss certain concepts regarding theendowment (\"the ritual\").However, there are certain elements I can notdiscuss with anyone (including other saints)outside of the temple.As a portion of the endowment, we receive thetokens and signs that will permit us accessto Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred and respect the conditions under which it isrevealed to me.   \n",

I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,   \n",

                                             The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance. A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.   \n",

Mybrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due toother problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to dowould be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a roomwith nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key outunderneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  Youwould like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hashthings out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, andpossibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope totie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmerwould include:   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that thisrelationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don'tunderstand where you're coming from.)   reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that wedid this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for thiswas ....)   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really aredecorational and functional at the same time.)   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be somegunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but weretruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, thisshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologizeabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping thingssmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty betweenwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be acompromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyoneinvolved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.   \n",

ammunition?  Why not get rid of the guns?It is worse than others?  The National Anthem?  Should it be changed too?God Bless America?  The list goes on...Then you'd be no better than the people you despise.Oh?An endorsement, or an acknowledgement?  I think gods are things that peopleare proud of, but I don't think the motto encourages belief.Is it?[...]Would you approve of such a motto?And removing the tool will solve the problem?Or will it increase the problem?   \n",

Although a desire to show others of one's rightness maybe a sign of arrogance in some cases,  it may be only a sign that they arefollowing the Bible in others:Jude :22-23 \"Be merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire andsave them; to others show mercy, mixed with  ^^^^^^ fear -- hating  ^^^^ even^^^^ the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.\"I hope you don't find me arrogant, then.  This sounds like a bad practice --ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant.James 1:19 \"My dear brothers, take note of this:  Everyone should be quick tolisten, slow to speak and slow to become angry,\"   \n",

         (deletion) Straw man. And you brought up leniency.   Assuming that misjudgements are not correlated.  (Deletion) Has been discussed here. Chapter and verse were cited, I assume that youweren't looking then. Let's be more exact, do you think it is not in the Quran?. And what wouldyour consequences be when it it was shown to be in it?   I have not claimed that. It is sufficient for the argument when there area lot of male dominated societies that qualify as Machistic. Are you goingto say that the situation of women is better in sufficeint areas of theOrient?  (Deletion) You apparently have trouble reading things you don't like. The point washaving sex the way one wishes being a strong desire. Marriage is a redherring. Tell me about homosexuals, for one. You simply ignore everythingthat doesn't fit into the world as you would like to have it.   \n",

I think basically the reasoning was that thetradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin wasmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virginfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born witha predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predispositionbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When sciencediscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume thatMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemedto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, thatbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.   \n",

In the phrase \"kosher for passover\" the French word used was \"Pa^ques.\"   We've deliberately mistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods being kosher for Easter. :-)Back to the original questions in this thread concerning Christians of Jewish descent and the Law:  I always wonder when I see posts on this subject whether the writers are Christians of Jewish descent relating the life-decisions God has led them to or people who take only an academic interest in the topic.  (Having known Seanna since she was nine years old, I do know in this case.)  I admit that the answer to this question affects the amount of weight I give to the writer's statement.   \n",

                            I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators.As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scripturesinto the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read).It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governmentswant the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is notcultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books(autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  Onethat stands out in my mind as an excellent is called \"Peace Child.\"This would give a true picture of what their mission is.I agree with this statement, but we cannot also accept what otherssay without looking into the issues.  That would be the same as taking Suddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.  We must lookat both sides.   \n",

It's a very biblical doctrine asRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Churchhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to saythat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in freewill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is alsoaffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists andJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up withthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of finalperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that thosewithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew theirobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not needit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their owneffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestinedthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perishbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they weredeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, andsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody someblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  Andthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this oneor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporalpunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder wereforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And Ineed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement isquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred fromthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should wenot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be moreWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), butdoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with theU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am anisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But inthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarilyinvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are thepeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Ouractions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which isunrelated to anything to justify it for us.   \n",

I thought it was only going to talk.origins.I also took my definitions from a 1938 Websters. Nonetheless, the apparent past arguments over these words imply that like'bimonthly' and 'biweekly' they have no commonly accepted definitions andshould be used with care.   \n",

buddy!  Second, read what I wrote.  I'm nottalking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do, merely what *SOME*practice.  They consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retortwith the old and tired \"they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS\" bullshit.  If Igave you the names what will you do with this information?  Is a fatwagoing to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  Do you honestly thinkthat someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess? With the kind of extremism shown by your co-religionaries?  Fat chance.At any rate, there can be no conclusive \"proof\" by the very nature ofthe act.  Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you intheory, but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end.I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslimsin this regard.  Also, kind of silly.  Are you insinuating that becausethe Koranic law forbids it, there are no criminals in muslim countries? This is as far as I care to go on this subject.  The weakness of yourarguments are for all netters to see.  Over and out...--    \n",

I did not clearly state it.The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrationalattitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because theirassumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's alack of consistency here.Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that Goddoes not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rationalpeople have problems with that \"logic\"?But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point wasthat mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate whothey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross orhammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it'sstill a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but alsobecause people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that hehad wrought.First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will notsway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?One of the big reasons is that many, many people want somethingbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I forone can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.Can love as a truth be proven, logically?John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to seehow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boastin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,Jesus, for instance.I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidencesupporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supportinglove as truth is subjective.No apology necessary.  :)--Bake Timmons, III   \n",

Please enlighten me.  How is omnipotence contradictory?: : >By definition, all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules: >of nature. Thus god cannot break them. Anything that god does must be allowed: >in the rules somewhere. Therefore, omnipotence CANNOT exist! It contradicts: >the rules of nature.: : Obviously, an omnipotent god can change the rules.When you say, \"By definition\", what exactly is being defined;certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the \"rules ofnature\" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature butactually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear yourfurther thoughts on the question.   \n",

one, in a number of ways.I don't know.  What is wrong?  Is it possible for humans to survive fora long time in the wild?  Yes, it's possible, but it is difficult.  Humansare a social animal, and that is a cause of our success.Isn't it?  Why don't you think so?No.  As noted earlier, lack of mating (such as abstinence or homosexuality)isn't really destructive to the system.  It is a worst neutral.Again, the mating practices are something to be reexamined...   \n",

Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard.\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesiesanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let anothertake\" concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able tolabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.   \n",

Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  Andwhy are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  IsGod trying to confuse us?But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portrudingfrom varying translations of biblical texts by \"serious students\" thatare much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible,then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would beno need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybethe Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough toread it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving ussomething we cannot use correctly.IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, andthe Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFOREthe Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John istrying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplationof the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bibleas a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.God alone is the final authority.   \n",

The material in John (I'm not sureexactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarityto the Matt./Luke \"Q\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almostany relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight fromJesus' mouth.The version of the \"usual theory\" I have heard has Matthew and Lukeindependently relying on Mark and \"Q\".  One would think that if Luke reliedon Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,for one thing.This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible thatyou could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existingcopy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can bewritten, and therefore survival becomes more probable.I'm not really impressed with the \"theology\" argument.  But I'm reallypointing this out as an \"if\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot makethese arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as anauthentic letter.The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which isnot so bad.But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it'sagreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.   \n",

Your logic is falty.  If Christianity is a DRUG, and once we die wedie, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so thatwhile you are alive you enjoy yourself.I also question your overall motives for posting this article.  Whywould you waste your presious fews seconds on this earth posting youropinon to a group that will generally reject it.If you die, never having acepting Christ as your savior, I hope youhave a fantastic life that it is all you evver dreamed because it isal of heaven you will ever know.   \n",

It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.

Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.

However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.

The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\"        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), asspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more.\"   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"nomore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph &amp; wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines.\"This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases.\"As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened. While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name.\"The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to theChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed andplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninthhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &amp;Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them.\"The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world.\"Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have toldus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of theworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not. Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian &amp; Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.\f",
       "Jesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt.\"Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet.\"Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool.\"       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever.\"The word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm aboutDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses &amp; Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me.\"This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter'sfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,&amp; Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots.\"First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!\"Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"thelamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb formwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.\f",
       "Reckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!\"This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\"        And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise.\"Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generationshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will notpass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God comingdown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one ofthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) wasthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would notbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguishbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him most.First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood.\"It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to somedegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus'shuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required byorthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God ora tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will cannever be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came tothis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  Hedesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  Ifthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that thiscup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men andwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucificationwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people acceptJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established onthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish peopleexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine whatkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very differentworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that agecould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was onthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that wouldhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world tolive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have towait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognizedand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for hisreturn.  It's been almost 2000 years.MikeAnd the two simplest refutations are these:(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and thatthe recorded \"impact\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no othercontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtainbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrectionis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 yearsafter the supposed event.(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because noone knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likelyexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in onegospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might makeup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament doesrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were reallyguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.</td>\n",

Paul adapted themessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, thismarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? Tobe \"weak in the faith\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do thebest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?Let me make clear that the \"Law\" is none other than the Pentateuch ofGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus sayabout the \"Law\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \"Law\" onlyapplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \"Law\"?Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at thispoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the onlyrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it wasMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why botherwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has tosay?I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you afollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying thatthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Whosays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is thisreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting ratherlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you everconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter whatyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts ofJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indicationsthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, orGod of all humankind of all race and sex?This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.Are you Christian or Pauline?Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Lawwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?Are you Christian or Pauline?You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you Christian or Pauline?When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?....Are you Christian or Pauline?[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what isnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly withthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why Ihave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studiesof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can'tcome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, variousChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and inother newsgroups.Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say thatit applies to Gentiles.And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on theSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you'relooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it'sunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However wedo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesusdealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealtwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't seethat there's a big problem.</td>\n",

Please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of noone, except myself ;-)][...]\\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\\tcontent in their ignorance.\\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\\tstructure with biology at the apex).\\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\\tunderlying presuppositions.\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\tis the case).\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\tconversion).\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\ta more expansive view.\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\\tknit relationship with this appelation.\\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\\tthings flow.\\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\\tthat nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\\tWhat do you know of Him?   \n",

I did not clearly state it.The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrationalattitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because theirassumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's alack of consistency here.Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that Goddoes not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rationalpeople have problems with that \"logic\"?But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point wasthat mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate whothey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross orhammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it'sstill a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but alsobecause people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that hehad wrought.First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will notsway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?One of the big reasons is that many, many people want somethingbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I forone can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.Can love as a truth be proven, logically?John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to seehow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boastin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,Jesus, for instance.I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidencesupporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supportinglove as truth is subjective.No apology necessary.  :)--Bake Timmons, III   \n",

When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version ofthe Bible do you read Mike ?Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.' Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and theangels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same wayand that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many wouldcome claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns. These are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-)   \n",

an endorsement of ones behavior.A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus saidthat people would come to Him saying \"Lord, Lord,\" and proclaimingthe miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tellthem that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and todepart from Him.  That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexualsin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He wouldnot be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.But people should be careful not to think, \"God has given me a gift ofthe Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.\"  That is dangerous (see also hebrews6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of the world to come.)Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselvesout of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes ournature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates themorality that God has set forth.  If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's.Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be thehomosexual's or the one considered \"ignorant?\"   \n",

I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The manyverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have beenshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussionof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as wellas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those versesand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. Wemust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on theinterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips withthem.   \n",
       "127  The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the  incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb  through my archives and pull out some of \"The Best of Alt.Atheism\"  for your reading pleasure.  I'll post a couple of these a day  unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good  material.  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,  but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest  of my entire collection.________________________________________________________                                  So that the                                  Prophecy be                                   Fulfilled                                     * * *       In considering the Christian religion, and judging itaccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\"        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), asspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more.\"   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"nomore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines.\"This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases.\"As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened. While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name.\"The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to theChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed andplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninthhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them.\"The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world.\"Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have toldus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of theworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not. Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.\n",
       "Jesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt.\"Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet.\"Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool.\"       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever.\"The word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm aboutDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses & Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me.\"This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter'sfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,& Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots.\"First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!\"Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"thelamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb formwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.\n",
       "Reckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!\"This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\"        And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise.\"Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generationshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will notpass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                  I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God comingdown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one ofthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) wasthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would notbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguishbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him most.First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood.\"It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to somedegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus'shuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required byorthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.   \n",

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of theexistence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priestsor straight from their own scriptures as the \"proof\", this does not satisfy atheists.Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic asyou claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time theygot up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc.represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part ofus that makes us ask the question \"Does God exist?\" i.e. self-awareness andreason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorantas the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, ifwe do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And sincewe can only use faith, why is one picture of \"God\" (e.g. Hinduism) any lessvalid than another (e.g. Christianity)?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                  Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God ora tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will cannever be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came tothis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  Hedesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  Ifthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that thiscup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men andwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucificationwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people acceptJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established onthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish peopleexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine whatkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very differentworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that agecould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was onthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that wouldhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world tolive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have towait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognizedand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for hisreturn.  It's been almost 2000 years.MikeAnd the two simplest refutations are these:(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and thatthe recorded \"impact\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no othercontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtainbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrectionis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 yearsafter the supposed event.(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because noone knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likelyexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in onegospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might makeup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament doesrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were reallyguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.   \n",

mind about what is right and what is missingthe mark?Are they clear or do you have doubts?An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best,very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar withthe Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted themessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, thismarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? Tobe \"weak in the faith\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do thebest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?Let me make clear that the \"Law\" is none other than the Pentateuch ofGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus sayabout the \"Law\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \"Law\" onlyapplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \"Law\"?Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at thispoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the onlyrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it wasMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why botherwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has tosay?I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you afollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying thatthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Whosays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is thisreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting ratherlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you everconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter whatyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts ofJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indicationsthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, orGod of all humankind of all race and sex?This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.Are you Christian or Pauline?Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Lawwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?Are you Christian or Pauline?You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you Christian or Pauline?When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?....Are you Christian or Pauline?[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what isnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly withthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why Ihave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studiesof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can'tcome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, variousChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and inother newsgroups.Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say thatit applies to Gentiles.And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on theSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you'relooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it'sunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However wedo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesusdealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealtwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't seethat there's a big problem.   \n",

There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?</td>\n",

Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoiaand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believesthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which iscorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he hadonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, theorthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and twoenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfectharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesuscame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a humanwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject tooriginal sin.It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to thisconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures butnot two wills or two energies.

       "      <td>I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Tim:You say that you were a \"catholic,\" but if you do not believe in the ChristianGod (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,   you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  \"Public heretics, eventhose who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the bodyof the Church\" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to theChurch by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judgethe condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   n. 16) teaches: \"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not knowthe Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with asincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His willas they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too mayachieve eternal salvation.\"  Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processesof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is oneof the best sources for learning what can be known about God.  Stick with the best.-- boundary, the catechist</td>\n",

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Doesthe being need to be self aware?What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals ofthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don'tyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?   \n",

Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd senseof history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who weremostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most peopletoday? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only thecream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write.

This was aheresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  Itgrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesusare two different people who happened to be united in the same bodytemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoiaand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believesthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which iscorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he hadonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, theorthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and twoenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfectharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesuscame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a humanwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject tooriginal sin.It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to thisconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures butnot two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late councilin Constantinople I believe.Andy Byler   \n",

In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?   \n",

A reader down the road will get the impression that themother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was justa casual statement.Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can befulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \"Beware, theterminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\" and then after 2 secs I turnit off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there wasno prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment ofthe Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that itwas predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time hascome.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - ifyou can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of thestate does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was usedin order to push for the establishment of the state.Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.-leo   \n",

Theharshly with all secessionist movements.the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealtvery harshly with all secession movements.I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long timewas Benny Murdani -- a \"Christian\".  Indonesia has been heavy handed inEast Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armedforces.  The people who make up theIndonesian government are in general motivated by national interests,not religious ones.   \n",

As you said, only God can judgethe condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   n. 16) teaches: \"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not knowthe Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with asincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His willas they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too mayachieve eternal salvation.\"  Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processesof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is oneof the best sources for learning what can be known about God.  Stick with the best.-- boundary, the catechist    \n",

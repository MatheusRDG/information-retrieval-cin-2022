If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be ""witnessed.""  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?

885,"Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me,an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)Can you reconcile this?I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your ownbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that you in fact interpret?",christian,0,1

The dispensationaldistinction is unwarranted.I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus isgoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- formillions perhaps billions of people.

896,"I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.

897,"Really>`?No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess informationother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectivelydetermine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state thateverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean thatit cannot be objective in theory.Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likelythe only ones to be considered ""immoral"" under the previous ""definitions""of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since theclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective systembecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which wouldnecessitate some sort of grand design?I think I have.

901,"I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this isbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.",christian,1,1

There are other animals on this planet with advanced	mental facilities which have not developed ""religion"" as a	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?	Further, it appears that only humans have a ""need"" to explain the	unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,	including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly	content in their ignorance.	I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me	from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need	not be researched; 3) religion was ""made up"" by humans to address a	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical	structure with biology at the apex).	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the	underlying presuppositions.	I disagree that Christianity is ""an infectious cult"".  It has	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is	""infectious"" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this	is the case).	I disagree that Christianity is ""a safety blanket"" which supplants	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a	Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of	control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?	Finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian	in the Person of God's Spirit.	Heaven is one of two final states that	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived	benefits to them in the here-and-now.	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask	""Why?""  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or	harm others if the sole purpose of being a ""friend"" is to gain a	conversion).	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a ""hurry-up""	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.	We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die	just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find	a more expansive view.	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing	arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language	of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social	structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)	Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.	Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not	a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship	with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-	knit relationship with this appelation.	There are ""Jesus freaks"" who let the emotional aspects of worship	and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these	things flow.	Guilty by association?  That ""christianity"" which forces itself	upon another is not Christianity at all.

906,"  The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not inthe almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, andnot an entirely different source.   We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usualexplanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not considertheir respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Lukethat of Matthew (and probably that of Mark). As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidencefor that is not overwhelming, admittedly.   When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order onputting John after the rest of the three?   Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would befine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?   That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument. The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof John itself. Is there any other evidence for it? One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.

907,"Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead"" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter""(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were ""forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptismsand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.We can discuss certain concepts regarding theendowment (""the ritual"").However, there are certain elements I can notdiscuss with anyone (including other saints)outside of the temple.As a portion of the endowment, we receive thetokens and signs that will permit us accessto Heaven.

908,"[text deleted]I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions.I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certaintypes of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding tohere).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is ""obvious""ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.""The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,",christian,0,1

Mybrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due toother problems with the relationship).

Youwould like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hashthings out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, andpossibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope totie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmerwould include:   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that thisrelationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don'tunderstand where you're coming from.)   reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that wedid this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for thiswas ....)   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really aredecorational and functional at the same time.)   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be somegunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but weretruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, thisshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologizeabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping thingssmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty betweenwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be acompromise.

916,"It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that thetradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin wasmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virginfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born witha predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predispositionbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When sciencediscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume thatMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.

919,"Vera Shanti Noyes writes;Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine asRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Churchhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to saythat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in freewill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is alsoaffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists andJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up withthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of finalperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that thosewithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew theirobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not needit, as they had freely chosen hell.							  ^^^^^^^^^^^People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their owneffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestinedthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perishbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they weredeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, andsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody someblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  Andthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this oneor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporalpunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder wereforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And Ineed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement isquite prevelant in the Bible.

But inthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarilyinvolved, it would not be a ""just war.""

928,"There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard.""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesiesanything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let anothertake"" concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able tolabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.",christian,0,1

933,"I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.  I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for thethrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it islegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone'sdecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he canhave a more ""deep, committed relationship.""Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because hecan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautifulyoung blonde?

934,"You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to becontentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdictionand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying thatPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basicallystood by the Pope.It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter isdisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also overauthority and discipline.  My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX  don't jointly make such  choice.)If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.If I adopt the view that ""I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, andthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours"", thatI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdictionviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in EcumenicalCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation ofthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going intothe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree thata split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic gameslike ""He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he doesis effective..."".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the ""real""traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matterEast and West would not have been separated for over 900 years. I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allowerror in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statementregarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, howdo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,one way or the other.It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view thePope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.

937,"Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understandwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you willcome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this is what James means when he says that ""faith without works is dead"" and, ""I will show you my faith by my works.""  Remember James was writing to ""the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.""  This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others heintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to thepeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning ofthe Greek.Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul'sstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paulcontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing thegospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the greatburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would goconvert a bunch of people, then the ""Judizers"" would come along andtry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cfActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of beingsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the bloodof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translationfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think""faithfulness"" today has a meaning closer to what the originalwriters intended.I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying isthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not ""keep kosher"" to akosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important mattersof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus inthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again inthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates thatthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.[I agree with you in general, including the fact that ""pistis"" hassome of the force of ""faithful"".  However if you take that too far,you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not haveintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To saythat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that weare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula thatcompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'dcall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust andcommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basicchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to showthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in anyChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation thatJesus calls being born again.",christian,0,1

951,"Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as   provided for in canon law.Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's ""schism""; often thebasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:- true obedience- false obedience- disobedience- schismTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2important elements involved here for my purposes:1) a command2) the response made to the commandAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as thePope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can beILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the godDagon when every other full moon comes around.As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to dowhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:command         response            name-----------------------------------------------------LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedienceILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedienceLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedienceILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedienceSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature ofthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough toconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are""obedient"" or ""disobedient"".  You also have to take into considerationwhether the commands are good or bad.In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the godDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainlyrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But thatalone is insufficient to allow one to label them ""disobedient"".  Youalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have beencommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have ofcourse disagreed.So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weakPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the onlyway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what thetraditional teaching of the Church is.The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea ofwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion ofAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  Youwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic pressin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine Iget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of theSociety of Saint Pius X.)Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is somesoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventuallysome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, thePopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing tohelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, ifthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the veryleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failingto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs thisbadly.Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimatecommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, soit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers areschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply withthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute aschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in anydecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right tocommand.Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.    (from the CE article ""Schism"")Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clearno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him everyday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside theconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their positionis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience andschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because theythink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching ofthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someonewho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read theHoly Father's motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", you can find out.  It's thedefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specificallyPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letterthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Popehimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvreconstituted a schismatic act.2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the natureof Tradtion.Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interestingarticle in a translation of the Italian magazine ""Si Si No No"".  Itall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopalconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then theywould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunicationunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this isthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopalconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the powerof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must beconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as thePope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quitewell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction overanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.The ""Si Si No No"" article was interesting in that it posited that thereason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the articleto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe theyquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholictheology.  So why does the Pope think this?As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here'sthe passage in question:    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who        have received, along with their right of succession in the        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.    (Papal motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", 2 July 1988)It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that canbe simplified to the following:- Vatican Council II has happened.- I am the Pope.The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove thatArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.This is weak, to say the least!It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressedArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II'sstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, PiusIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed toignore what all these Popes said on the subject?I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in theSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.--------------------------------------------------------------[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey""justified disobedience"" or even ""obeying God rather than man"".Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice inWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Popesays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition itexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it willshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thingyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will itdo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but inthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of churchdiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused hispowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else tosay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism isall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline arenot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generallyit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally theyhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the doorto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be trulyobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to commandthat you say defines schism.",christian,0,0

953,One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.,christian,0,1

Why do atheists organize in groups?  What is there to discuss?Response:Many things are discussed here, including:* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's  family* Prayer in schools* Discrimination against atheists* Sunday trading laws* The Satanic Child Abuse myth* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual* Why people become atheistsOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christianslooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.------------------------------Subject: Hitler was an atheist!Typical posting:Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!Response:Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his   religious community and tries to butt into the other.   [...]   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]          -- Adolf Hitler, from ""Mein Kampf"", trans. Ralph Mannheim.Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that beliefwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, though.------------------------------Subject: The Bible proves itTypical posting:In the Bible it says that...Response:Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionableaccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who wererecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that TheBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before beingaccepted.Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage issubject to ""interpretation"", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing andone thing only is not legitimate.Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore otherequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.------------------------------Subject: Pascal's WagerTypical posting:If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go tohell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.Response:This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there aremany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is oftendescribed as the ""avoiding the wrong hell"" problem.  If a person is afollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.Secondly, the statement that ""If you believe in God and turn out to beincorrect, you have lost nothing"" is not true.  Suppose you're believing inthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine infavour of prayer.Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly theargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:  1. One does not know whether God exists.  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does     exist.  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as anassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, inthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This isconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has noinformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial informationcan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violatesinformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, atno ""cost"".The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  Theproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states theChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. Theargument thus collapses to ""If you are a Christian, it is in your intereststo believe in God"" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascalintended the argument to be viewed.The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God isomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes asa wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at allwhether people believe in him.------------------------------Subject: What is Occam's Razor?Typical posting:People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?Response:William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's Razor.  In its original form, it said ""Do not multiply entities unnecessarily.""  That is, if you can explain something without supposingthe existence of some entity, then do so.Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it more generally, for example as ""Take the simplest solution"".The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us:1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, whichcame into being as a result of natural processes.2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity.Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  We just imagine that there is.This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable. ------------------------------Subject: Why it's good to believe in JesusTypical posting:I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.Response:Preaching is not appreciated.Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings thatare on a ""conversion"" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism andwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgrouptalk.religion.misc).You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favouritenewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you wouldhave them do unto you!Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthyanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know thebasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tellatheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.------------------------------Subject: Why I know that God existsTypical posting:I *know* from personal experience  and prayer that God exists.Response:Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worshipexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do notexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, manypeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have beenabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.------------------------------Subject: Einstein and ""God does not play dice""Typical posting:Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?Response:Einstein did once comment that ""God does not play dice [with the universe]"". This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in theChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein'srefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:""I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony ofwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions ofhuman beings.""Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in anobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to randomevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed thatQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need forstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,and much evidence suggests that it never will be.A longer quote from Einstein appears in ""Science, Philosophy, and Religion, ASymposium"", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religionin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In  ""The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a   personal God interfering with natural events could never be   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably   more worthy task...""  ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our   science can reveal it.""The latter quote is from ""Albert Einstein: The Human Side"", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  Also from the same book:  ""I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind    it.""Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false.------------------------------Subject: Everyone worships somethingTypical posting:Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.Response:If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much aboutthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (forexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.------------------------------Subject: Why there must be a causeless causeTypical posting:Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, sochains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.Response:The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but hasno smallest member.Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that doesnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, andespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured byany particular religion.------------------------------Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designedTypical posting:The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely youdon't think all this appeared here just by chance?Response:This is known as the Argument From Design.It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in theuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of livingcreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read thenewsgroup talk.origins for a while.There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour ofso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of theuniverse and life on earth.The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence ofsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable thatsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaosdeliberately.But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mindcapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings mustbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of theexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationistposition.This leads us to the familiar theme of ""If a creator created the universe,what created the creator?"", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was notcreated and just ""is"" (or ""was"").From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universejust ""is"" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book""A Brief History of Time"", explains his theory that the universe is closedand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch onthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that itevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation.Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.------------------------------Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is trueTypical posting:The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentaryevidence.  For example...Response:The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentaryevidence.Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus orJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Manyscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, butthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several ""reconstructions"" ofthe original text have been published to this effect.Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberatefalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'thefirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who isgenerally given the title of authorship for this material.Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus ismore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the FrequentlyAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.------------------------------Subject: Godel's Incompleteness TheoremTypical posting:Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for theBible to be both true and complete.Response:Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that  it can model ordinary arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technicallyspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decisionprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system.)Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a ""Liar Paradox.""  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is ""This sentence is false.""  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claimsthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible toprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove theexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axiomsthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to showthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, thatwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God existswithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything aboutwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing aboutthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstratesthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot beboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formalsystems, so such claims are nonsense.------------------------------Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotismTypical posting:Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?Response:The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Shermanis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member ofthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announcefederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to thepresidential primary: RS: ""What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"" GB: ""I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in      God is important to me."" RS: ""Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of      Americans who are atheists?"" GB: ""No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under      God."" RS: ""Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation      of state and church?"" GB: ""Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not      very high on atheists.""UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations werestill angry over the remarks.The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,1989.  It can also be found in ""Free Enquiry"" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned alawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated SchoolDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son topledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as ""one nation under God""(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:  RS: ""American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?""  EM: ""It's bullshit.""  RS: ""What is bullshit?""  EM: ""Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.""  RS: ""Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush      campaign is on this issue."" EM: ""You're welcome.""After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retracthis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to thePresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by  ""As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or   supported by the government.""For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the AmericanAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.------------------------------Subject: I know where hell is!Typical posting:I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!Response:There are several towns called ""Hell"" in various countries around theworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildlyamusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.------------------------------Subject: Biblical contradictions wantedTypical posting:Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?Response: American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblicalcontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources fordetails.There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from thearchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.------------------------------Subject: The USA is a Christian nationTypical posting:Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't theUnited States be considered a Christian nation?Response:Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clearthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are somequotes; there are many more.  ""What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,   needs them not.""      - James Madison, ""A Memorial and Remonstrance"", 1785  ""I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!""      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson  ""History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will   always avail themselves for their own purpose.""      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813  ""I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely   above it.""      - Benjamin Franklin, from ""Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion"",        Nov. 20, 1728------------------------------Subject: The USA is not a Christian nationTypical posting:Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in anysense founded upon the Christian religion?Response:No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treatyof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):   Article 11   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption   of the harmony existing between the two countries.The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collectionssuch as Charles Bevans' ""Treaties and Other International Agreements of theUnited States of America 1776-1949"", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate onJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It wasrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks thequotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, ConsulGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent ofChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since thereis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained thequotation.",altheism,1,0

In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under 7).

958,"[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]    For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to anepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way ofknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existenceof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Mostphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one thatmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logicalbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing? There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absenceof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elsesword ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to bereliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidenceeverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge aboutgods? The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally thenone of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faithis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptablebasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable atother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheistbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliableknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position thantheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all otherknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather thanSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny? I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn'trequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe thatthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best andsimplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held untilcontrary evidence is found.",altheism,1,0

Just like plants ""create"" oxygen using light through photosynthesis.  It's a much bigger leap to talk about something thatcreated ""everything"" from nothing.

960,"Golgotha the whole process of the fall of manThis was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who livedimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his sonNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had astronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause ofhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting onhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting. It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, andthus he became the ""Elevator of the heavens.""  This ""god"" made men able to""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the God of Heaven could notsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers ofHis laws.""  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""Emancipator""or ""Deliverer""  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal systemand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given manybenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as aDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the otheractually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept itas true.I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward tothe coming ""Anointed One"" and put their faith in the fact that it was God whowas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to theCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, thedispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see itas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvationvia faith and nothing else.I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of itbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with theeternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternallife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation ofconsciousness.  It depends upon your def of ""lost.""  The elect were lost only in time asoutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. Existentially we were all born ""lost"", but the ""righteous"" were ""in Christ"" andtherefore never *assuredly* lost.  Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simplyhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.Couldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, isclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referringto.No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again Ithink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a veryinteresting study. >The similarity in the midst of great variety ofYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want theunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as ""mystery"" religionsfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the privateside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if theyrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachingsto light. The ""Mystery of Iniquity"" that we find in the Bible, correlates tothis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it wouldnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in pointtoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris inEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the ""husband son."")No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that thechurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into theirworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If youare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came toexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that whichthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned anddiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and alsothe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's ""Egyptians.""  He reallydoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from theEgyptians. I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

962,"The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but Ithought I'd hop on, anyway...What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer'sfall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculationthan based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - isthat, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet hehad the free will to ""choose"" evil.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find acontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, andcan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whateverGod happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that Godis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because Heis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He ispowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when hetells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if youdefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makessense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if youdon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction toGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes anyfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgementsare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgementsin particular cases about the course of action most likely toachieve a good result.When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God inhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what Imight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the naturalworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author ofthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sortof difficulties that they find in Nature."")Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself anargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Supposethat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that everytime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: ""Good move!Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made ifI were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better achess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that atleast some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do supposeinduced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- he'sjust thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands theworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected thatsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at thecontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chessgame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it wascarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was atime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and didnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I hadthought.With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the totalresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judgingthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakierthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sellhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, andwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for hisfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: ""Donot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews   and of Judaism.        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into   the Promised Land.        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge   of all humans everywhere.        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism   saved them.        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking   at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most   memorable line of the evening.        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus   Epiphanes....After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to himprivately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, weren'tyou?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind,then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would nottalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assumethat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been nostate of Israel.Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusionthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish Hispurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  goon to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that Hestirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, andthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh'sheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.And this raises questions about how an action can be consideredwicked and at the same time be considered something that God hasbrought about.I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who hasa log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knotthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considersthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features theknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and colorof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so thatobservers will say: ""How fortunate the sculptor was in finding apiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Itspresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue agreat work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor waslooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had notcontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, Godwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had notbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejectedJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, ifPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had setJesus free, it might appear that there would have been noCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore noSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. IfJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciledthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not knowhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if itsinterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, andjust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourthgame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishopsand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look upthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point isnone the less valid).Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice ofPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardicewas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God'splans by behaving justly and courageously.What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""Iwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go""?Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppetwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and crueltywere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose ratherthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: ""If you seethat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not bediscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. Mypurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you andlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit hisresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that futurehistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have beenthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possiblethat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, areinstruments of God's will?     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as whatJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, thatdoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation andpunishment.     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But notthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder.

970,"Strictly speaking, you're right - we can't repent _for_ somebody else,for what they've done.  I guess I don't think it's out of line to talkabout a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participationin ""The sins of society"" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) ofsinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plainbegging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement onour whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to dofor the sake of Lot.  (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)A few times lately when I've observed some either out-and-out sinful activity, or just some self-destructive activity, I've gotten a strongimpression that many folks really don't know any better.  Christ's pityon the crowds as being ""like sheep without a shepherd"" rings true to me.If these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for mynot having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?

971,"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly afterhis marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of levelfor most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, withhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imaginedslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'llhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I'veseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keepthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contactwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is hischoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have arelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painfulrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, ""Whybe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuseto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides tocome back."" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go onwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best Icould think of.   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't goingto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was theoutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed andraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, andin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation wasbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all theallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would notquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of theirrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hungup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this isthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as ifshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have thebreak out in the open and done with.     I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, forpersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping theirchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at mybrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or usthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying toappease an unappeasable,emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things willchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-righteous over this bit of proof that they can't ""get away"" with treatingus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for evenbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped ina horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--orthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustratedbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives meup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am notfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete.

989,"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, otherthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses fromLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).Later,Max (Bob) Muir[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonlycited passages are:the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, andthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediateposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in theBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been knownspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered acesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape ofguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specificallyabout homosexuality.In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's aboutidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or atleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over thispassage.  It does not use the word ""homosexuality"", and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality.The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used heremean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,such as ""wanton"", and that another may be specifically ""maleprostitute"".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching abouthomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paulshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  Thecontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped inSodom were angels, it seems likely that ""strange flesh"" refers tointercourse with angels.As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note thatthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OTprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NTendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern inRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from hisbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in longdissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it'sclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  Thisappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as awhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the differencebetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where bothsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses.

If there is any Scripture fromwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and thesabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption ""the sabbath cannotbe a ceremonial law"" then he will have to find some way around it, likesaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the7tH day, Because ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.""

I wrote that human brains ""areinfested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed?The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be surethat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'llgrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument oranother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?You write:But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I amconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom `confident'.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutelycertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.

An atheist is one for whom all things canbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no needfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There isno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required byphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing isdetermnined.This would also have to include human intelligence of course and allits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that itacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, noevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or lessvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-an event can have value. The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,from teaching, training, observation and experience and are onlysignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mentalprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electricalactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The humanmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down ahill.How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizingthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? Onwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? Itseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, youhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but whatin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke toestablish your values.Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, whatdifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious orotherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The onlyway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that theobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimerthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carriesno weight in any ""absolute"" sense.That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about Godor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in yournervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupledwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That yourobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've beenconditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. The whole of yourintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism andto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any humanthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excludedyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have noweight whatsoever.",altheism,0,0

The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz...""        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But,       Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), asspecifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more.""   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""nomore.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,""it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).""       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines.""This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases.""As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened. While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name.""The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to theChristologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed andplundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninthhour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,""before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them.""The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long,       lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world.""Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have toldus.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of theworld.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not. Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.Jesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt.""Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise""spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet.""Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:	""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool.""       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever.""The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm aboutDavid.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses & Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me.""This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast       them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter'sfield"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,& Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots.""First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!""Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""thelamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him.""This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb formwhich can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.Reckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!""This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.""        And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise.""Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ.""         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generationshall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will notpass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.",altheism,1,0
1008,"Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com  Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like theythink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants ratherthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend totreat church as they would a club and when something is less than totheir liking, off they go to another one.I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at allbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a betterquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out whereGod is trying to place me.If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church theygo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family ofGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as theyhop from natural family to family.If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are morelike an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps""and see if anyplace feels like home. I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where youhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other handthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of lookingfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other handif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread thatwherever you go. In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church thattalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and isexpanding on that base.",christian,0,1

1021,"As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and returnto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate inthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish justinstituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned thingsthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" werealways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking aboutthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week overbreakfast Easter Sunday.My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called musicand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committeebut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a stronghand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strongas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additionalreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritualguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"". As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotesthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in atraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacramentof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelingsare not shared by everyone.I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningfulservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book ofWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (suchas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that itis Not there.Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"".My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigilswould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics whohave beared with me this far understand what I mean.Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Notto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is somethingwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest orpastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.

1026,"I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God comingdown to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one ofthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) wasthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity, then Jesus ""fully human"" (Nicea) would notbe ""subject to sin"", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguishbetween ""human"" and ""fallen human"" makes Jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him most.First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son ""uncreate"" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept ""Nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that ""Nestorianism"" is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""The Christological Controversy""refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says ""To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood.""It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have ""to somedegree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say ""I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus'shuman nature was in heaven.""  I don't think that's required byorthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.",christian,0,1

I generally have aBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up toCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy LoveAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in theoffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into mybriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home tofind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someonewants to do to my body.To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday totreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.

Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternatives.However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid.->	Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I ->write I will use it.JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if therewere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet fullfilled them anyway.->	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's ->sake.

That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in ->a while.  We box everything into time units.

1036,"[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishingpeople.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion onwhom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyedpunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesusto ""seek and save that which was lost"" (Luke 19:10)?You asked for it.2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous inGod's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for thedisciples ""will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut outfrom the presence of the Lord"".2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truthbeing condemned.Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomesand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be inthe ""fiery lake of burning sulfur"".Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast""will be tormented with burning sulfur"" and there being ""no rest day ornight"" for them because of it.Psalm 9:17:  ""The wicked return to the grave, all the nations thatforget God.""I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.Joe Fisher[In the following I'm mostly playing ""devil's advocate"".  I'm notadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand thatit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possibleto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev oftenuses the term ""second death"".  The most obvious understanding of thatwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaksboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses termsthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convinceyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand thatthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible tounderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primarypoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumablythey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to understand this passage in a non-literal way.)2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding themin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fireprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire iseternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having beenprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about theeternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophetwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people beingthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as ""the second death"".This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possiblethat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such asthe devil, and humans?2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is ""everlasting destruction""?This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly beunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to thinkthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destructionthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs ineternity.2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.Revelation 21:6-8: see comment aboveRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It saysthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the peopleare tormented forever.Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.",christian,0,1

1040,"This is not true.  The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of theexistence of God.

If they were as dogmatic asyou claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time theygot up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc.represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.Are you asking us to believe blindly?

The founder of thissect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be thePromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the majorreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming ofJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the PromisedMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost allthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messengerfrom God have been fulfilled.        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  andextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sectis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won manyadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, whocome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  abouta better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. AhmadiMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffedby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect'sinternal resources.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal religion.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================",christian,0,0
1046,": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged: couple become ""married"" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shallleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across thephraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. Thisimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at thepoint of intercourse.Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Marywas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (whichrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Maryand Joseph went to bed together.Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church isdescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship withJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage willtake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it isnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at thepoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean thecivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. amarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West sinceNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to becorrected on that point!)This view obviously raises some questions:What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without consideringmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessaryto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honoursthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleeptogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends beforeactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, andalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitiveto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)-- -----Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)",christian,0,1

Besides, we are talking about OT texts-  		which in many parts are superceded by the NT 		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same 		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_? 		This principle cannot be consistently applied. I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with onevoice, and he does not contradict himself.  The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspiredby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is moreguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decidedthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some bookssuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passagefrom this book.The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church'shistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as therest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added thesebooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is wherethis sort of discussion ultimately ends.",christian,0,0
1060,"You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements abouthis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,not a Muslim.Regarding Bernard Lewis:Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for hisgiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.Read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, andhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that hispolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamicpolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often basedon telling half-truths.Again, read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to takewhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to getthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for_yourself_.If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of someMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexualpurposes is necessarily opposed too.I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_who are not getting through to _you_.Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you beencompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted avery good one, under the title ""Islam and Women"", reposted fromsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of thisexcellent article.  IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is basedcompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses andhadiths to support its point of view.Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historicalstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'anand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and performa particular action, does that automatically mean that their action ispart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Ofcourse not.Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this foryou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says ""I am aMuslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now meanthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, andonly an idiot would think so.Do you see my point?You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is anideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximisetheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to becapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support afree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it isbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you thefallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) thatIslam => lack of education and power.For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For asignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost inthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education iscompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- historyshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must beother reasons for this situation.Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extentof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are notknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims arefollowing the Qur'an or not.The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at onestage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the Qur'an""that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesisthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historicalfact which contradicts your theory. You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education isquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your viewsmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all ofthis.I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.Here too.Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrateignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularlywith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so Ithink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts thatyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and startthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of ourpostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviouslyhave.",altheism,0,0

1062,"Responding to the moderator:Yes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convincedof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personalrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or thosebeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, toaccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think theconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefsarise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God.I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships withGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areasof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or revealed that truth.  -- comments, criticism welcome...-Kenalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu",christian,0,0

1064,"   If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the    Pope cannot ""be wrong!""  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter    of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the   Pope is the legal head of the church.   In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice   but to obey.This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying ismore or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's theidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific andwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he canmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.A couple historical examples come to mind.Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of theEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigningPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  BishopGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (thoughmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, evenwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would justcollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  BishopGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the BeatificVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be adefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around todefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholicdoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  Inthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, herecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of theChurch.If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of suchsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), youwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fallinto heresy or schism.",christian,0,0

1068,"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism ingeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalousactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut allthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.Joe Buehler...Schism and DisobedienceAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of theChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whateverthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, hemust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit tothe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power ofjurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make itclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts ofdisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at thebeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of Americanbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear inthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire deTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who iscertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schismand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. FatherCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existenceof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejectionof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept adecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does notconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopediaexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have tointend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  Itadds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess thischaracter it must include besides the transgression of the command ofthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not onlydoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority andhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop madehis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: ""We prayfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrationslast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul IIthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that heis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favorheresy.""...Intrinsically Schismatic?The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is inschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate isan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such aconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This isnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act itwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (seeCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty toexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismaticchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishopsdiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvreas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and theillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercisean apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any waythe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration ofbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than theordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of theprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the RomanPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting theChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed inresponse.It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code ofCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). Thefirst part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of theChurch"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, togetherwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offensesagainst the unity of the Church.But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of thiscanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense againstreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in hisexcommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties forSpecific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of EcclesialFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum EcclesiasticorumUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question isCanon 1382, which reads: ""A bishop who consecrates someone bishop andthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without apontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offenseof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurateparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter hadbeen convicted of first degree murder.I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinionof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyerswithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiatedthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. FatherPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the InstitutCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeursactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was notexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiasticalfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop whichconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon theillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel Church.Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for theAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrationsin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.....It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecratingbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the leastintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic andwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly thatthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him toconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. CanonLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes thatthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without theseconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that itcould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurredexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelatesas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannotexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against agreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted tothe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una VoceAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and heknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre andthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from astatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February1989 Remnant merits careful study:",christian,0,0

Ifthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that thiscup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men andwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucificationwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people acceptJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established onthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish peopleexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine whatkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very differentworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that agecould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was onthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that wouldhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world tolive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have towait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognizedand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for hisreturn.

I find it interesting that no othercontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtainbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrectionis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 yearsafter the supposed event.(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because noone knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likelyexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in onegospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might makeup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.

Thefacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century!

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect forothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systemswithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about mattersof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable byobjective means.  Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from thisthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosingthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for thehonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It isuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proudnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, thatleads to arrogance.

I thinkthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say""in agreement"") with the idea that you are finally responsible to thesecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person mayhave chosen.With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (""legally"" as mostpeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group oncethey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agreethat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is thereany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or pastgroup member.A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional dutiesof a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those dutiesin many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes whenthe enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person_in conflict with secular law_.This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secularauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.

1100,"Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble forstraying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but thereason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as weare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we donot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in.Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower than the angels""?I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid Davidwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliathwas, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks whathe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done thathis whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everythingand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples sayhow can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoidgetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committingadultery, we can control our own desires. I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how otherpeople see this. (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslimsworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"".Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a littlemore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, butyou're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think moreI must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond myconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu'sconception.

Paul adapted themessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, thismarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it?

Why botherwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has tosay?I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you afollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else?

Was Jesus God only of the Jews, orGod of all humankind of all race and sex?This is your understanding of Paul.

Are you Christian or Pauline?Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?....Are you Christian or Pauline?[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what isnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly withthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why Ihave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studiesof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can'tcome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, variousChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and inother newsgroups.Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say thatit applies to Gentiles.And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on theSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you'relooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it'sunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However wedo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesusdealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealtwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15more than Paul).

Itgrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesusare two different people who happened to be united in the same bodytemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoiaand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believesthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which iscorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he hadonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, theorthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and twoenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfectharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesuscame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a humanwill.

1106,"I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?",christian,0,0

Of course, his father may have said ""he 'llmake good money because of his hobby"" and depending upon the finaloutcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that'srelevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that themother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was justa casual statement.Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can befulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, ""Beware, theterminal will unexpectedly be shut off!"" and then after 2 secs I turnit off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there wasno prediction.

Theharshly with all secessionist movements.the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealtvery harshly with all secession movements.I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long timewas Benny Murdani -- a ""Christian"".  Indonesia has been heavy handed inEast Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armedforces.

1109,"Dear Tim:You say that you were a ""catholic,"" but if you do not believe in the ChristianGod (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,   you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  ""Public heretics, eventhose who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the bodyof the Church"" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to theChurch by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judgethe condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   n. 16) teaches: ""Those who, through no fault of their own, do not knowthe Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with asincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His willas they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too mayachieve eternal salvation.""  Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processesof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is oneof the best sources for learning what can be known about God.  Stick with the best.-- boundary, the catechist ",christian,0,0

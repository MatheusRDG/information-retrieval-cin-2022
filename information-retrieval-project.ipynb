       "      <td>Anyone who dies for a \"cause\" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?</td>\n",

Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Doesthe being need to be self aware?What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals ofthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don'tyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?   \n",

Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd senseof history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who weremostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most peopletoday? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only thecream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone inthe medieval period \"knew the rules\" it was a matter of uncriticallyaccepting what they were told.Bill Mayne   \n",

       "      <td>Anyone who dies for a \"cause\" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?</td>\n",

As forpeople being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters andcharlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield hadbeen the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't thefirst to be \"witnessed.\"  What sets him apart?Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.Koresh is a non-issue.Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in yourlogic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something iswritten in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plusthe lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if youdo quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you define the world \"total,\" but I would imagine a \"total sacrafice [sp]of everything for God's sake\" would involve more than a time commitment.You are correct about our tendency to \"box everything into time units.\"Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)television?   \n",

       "3  See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significantif it is \"voluntary.\"  Why do you think this?And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.You are attaching too many things to the term \"moral,\" I think.Let's try this:  is it \"good\" that animals of the same speciesdon't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they dois either right nor wrong?Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sortof mating ritual or whatnot.Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  Whatdo you mean by \"consider?\"  Can a small child be moral?  How abouta gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Doesthe being need to be self aware?What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals ofthe same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don'tyou find the fact that they don't at all significant?  "
